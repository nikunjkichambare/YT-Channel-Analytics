After successfully catching some fish, the children are moved by the sight of other creatures in the lake missing their friends. Touched by empathy, the kids decide to release the fish back into their natural habitat, teaching a valuable lesson about compassion and respect for all living beings.\nBaby Goes Fishing Song Lyrics :\n\nLet‚Äôs go fishing, \nDear daddy \nCome on, come on, come on! \nThe sun is bright and shiny \n\nDragonflies and leaping frogs \nAll around the lake \nMother nature has made them \nDon‚Äôt they look so great? \n\nFriendly fish of every kind \nJumping in and out \nCatch, catch, catch them \nCome on, pull them out \n\nSmiling ducks, swans and geese, \nSwim with webbed feet \nThey all make pretty pictures \nThey are cute and sweet \n\nLet‚Äôs sit by the shore \nAnd eat some snacks \nWe‚Äôll watch the frogs leap \nAnd listen to the duck‚Äôs quack \n\nCroak, croak, quack and quack \nThe frogs and ducks say \nThe fish are their friends \nThey want the fish to stay \nShall we let the fish go? \nThey look so sad \nLet‚Äôs put them back \nAnd make them all glad \nHee hee \nHee hee \nHooray! \n\nWe had so much fun \nWith our lake friends today \nLet‚Äôs go home now \nAnd come back another day \n\nLet‚Äôs go fish, fishing, \nIt‚Äôs a lot of fun! \nCome with us fishing! \nCome with us, everyone!\n\nTo download and watch this video anywhere and at any time, get the ChuChu TV Pro app now by clicking the below link!\nFor Android Phones and Tablets - https://chuchu.me/ChuChuTVAndroid\nFor Apple iPhones and iPads - https://chuchu.me/ChuChuTViOS Baby Goes Fishing Song - ChuChu TV Baby Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs\nClick here to Subscribe to our channel - https://bit.ly/32NxN7y\n\nView other NEW 3D Animated Nursery Rhymes with Baby Taku from ChuChu TV:\n\nBaby goes to Old MacDonald‚Äôs Farm - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBgOlyGpKrw\nBaby Loves Stargazing - Twinkle Twinkle Little Star - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1DtPUYby94\nBaby is Sick Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjIEhuRG0Ks\nPat A Cake Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuLy-llv3sU\nChuChu's Baa Baa Black Sheep - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FxhksvgHcw\nThe Boo Boo Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmqbbt-yyUQ\nBaby's Humpty Dumpty Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8oinWzA0Fs\nBaby's First Steps Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWkiwlFQ7cQ\nBath Song 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs_ll8GwhIE\nBaby Care and Share Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYMm_zgAGaQ\nNo No Brush My Teeth Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyI_eCTPT_A\nThe Muffin Man - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjbvlfxTgQw\nNo No Milk Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgRF3qhXlqI\nColor Song - The Wheels On The Bus - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4hvMJOvXWo\nHello Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El9VkQCh4sg\nABC Song with ChuChu Toy Train - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nkmarl4ynRM\nDoctor Checkup Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3XAfpxqfqQ\nYes Yes Fruits Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKm0g1boEhE\nWheels on the Bus Song - Baby Starts Crying - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FwA-1hMAb4\nBaa Baa Black Sheep Song - Colors of the Rainbow - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OuH7Ihbf-c\nBaby Goes Swimming Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvKHNShAaa4\nHickory Dickory Dock - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2jRSAOdwx0\nJohny Johny Yes Papa - Grandparents Version - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAtj5v27heE\nNo No Yes Yes Go to School Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GcLWywzQXY\nYes Yes Wake Up Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7si2KRHLls\n\nNursery rhymes in English,Piosenki dla dzieci po angielsku, canciones en ingl√©s para ni√±os,‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏•‡∏á‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡∏≠‡∏±‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏§‡∏©‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏´‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏î‡πá‡∏Å, Comptines en anglais,Kinderlieder in Englisch, Lagu-lagu anak berbahasa Inggeris, Musik Untuk Anak,Engelse kinderliedjes, M√∫sicas em ingl√™s para crian√ßas, Gyerekzene, barnvisorna p√• engelska, Ëã±ÊñáÂÖíÊ≠å, P√≠sniƒçky v angliƒçtinƒõ, ÿ£ŸÜÿßÿ¥ŸäÿØ ÿ£ÿ∑ŸÅÿßŸÑ ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ∫ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÜÿ¨ŸÑŸäÿ≤Ÿäÿ©, ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡§∞‡•ç‡§∏‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§è‡§Ç, Barnerim p√• engelsk, Canzoni per bambini in inglese \n\n===============================================\nVideo: Copyright 2022 ChuChu TV¬Æ Studios\nMusic and Lyrics: Copyright 2022 ChuChu TV¬Æ Studios\nChuChu TV ¬Æ, Cutians ¬Æ, all the characters and logos \nused are the registered trademarks of ChuChu TV Studios\n===============================================\n\n#ChuChuTV #NurseryRhymes"}, {"video_id": "Eb-RIxmYHLs", "title": "Yes Yes Stay Safe Song (Healthy Habits) + More ChuChu TV Baby Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs", "published_at": "2020-10-03T11:30:01Z", "view_count": 24513242, "like_count": 101443.0, "comment_count": 0.0, "duration": "PT31M54S", "category_id": "27", "tags": "yes yes stay safe;healthy habits;baby songs and dance;children songs;baby songs;nursery rhymes baby;nursery rhymes for babies;baby songs a b c d;songs for babies;baby songs nursery rhymes;nursery rhymes bingo;videos for babies;sing-along;kid songs;babies songs;Nursery Rhymes;baby songs sleep;sing-along songs;baby songs lyrics;nursery rhymes playlist for children;kids song;baby songs new;baby taku;chuchu tv;chuchu tv songs;boo boo song", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "channel_title": "ChuChu TV Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs", "description": "Get the cute Baby Taku's Toy Bestie Plush at the ChuChu TV Store.

One day, his daddy showed him a group of crows who were happily sharing their food and taking care of each other. Baby Taku was so inspired by their kindness and realized that sharing is caring. From that day on, he happily started sharing too!\n\nBaby Care and Share Song Lyrics :\n\nCome with me ‚Äì I've something to show! \nOn the tree-top, can you see a big crow? \nThere are many more of them sitting in a row! \nWhat are they doing there? You should know! \nDaddy, I can't see them all! \n\nBecause I am too small! \nThe crows are so happy sitting there! \nThey joyfully divide their food and share - \nEating together with love and care! \nReal joy is yours when you share \n\nThey care and share! \nLove is in the air! \nThey share and care! \nIsn‚Äôt that fair? \nThere's real joy when you share! \nSo share and care‚Ä¶ care and share! \n\nDaddy I do care care \nI will always share share \nLet's care and share!

Dear mommy when I was playing ball\nIt hit me in the back after bouncing on the wall\nI fell down hard and scratched my hand, I‚Äôm not quite sure how\nPlease save me from this painful Boo-boo now\n\nBaby don‚Äôt you cry, let me look at you\nMommy knows how to heal the Boo-boo\nWe‚Äôll wash and add some cream to make the Boo-boo all right\nNow my baby can play, You‚Äôre all right\n\nLovely little babies want to play and play\nSometimes an obstactle gets in their way\nA fall can cause a boo-boo and give them quite a fright\nBut then mommies fix the boo-boo‚Äôs and make it all alright\n\nTo download and watch this video anywhere and at any time, get the ChuChu TV Pro app now by clicking the below link!\nFor Android Phones and Tablets - https://chuchu.me/ChuChuTVAndroid\nFor Apple iPhones and iPads - https://chuchu.me/ChuChuTViOS\n.\n.\n.

They are then joined by their animal friends. They fly above to meet their beloved little star and family. To show their love and affection they entertain the little star and family by singing, dancing and playing music. They also give some gifts to the little star as a token of their love.\n\n\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" Lyrics:\n\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\nHow I wonder what you are.\nUp above the world so high,\nLike a diamond in the sky.\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/chuchutv\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/TheChuChuTV\nGoogle+ - https://plus.google.com/u/0/112211188590597855240/posts\n\n============================================\nMusic and Lyrics: Copyright 2016 ChuChu TV‚Ñ¢ Studios\nVideo: Copyright 2016 ChuChu TV‚Ñ¢ Studios\n============================================"}, {"video_id": "Ul3nQsM-Hmc", "title": "Chubby Cheeks Rhyme with Lyrics and Actions - ChuChu TV Nursery Rhymes Cartoon Animation Song Video", "published_at": "2013-02-14T09:18:56Z", "view_count": 100653424, "like_count": 92798.0, "comment_count": 0.0, "duration": "PT1M48S", "category_id": "27", "tags": "fun;swing;playing;playground;Merry-go-round;play;slide;Playlist;Nursery Rhymes;Twinkle Twinkle;dimple;rhymes;rhyme;Funny;kid;poem;dimpled;chubby;chubby cheeks;songs for children;kids;see saw;chin;cheeks;kids songs;rhymes for children;children songs;children rhymes;nursery rhymes songs;Wheels On The Bus;Chuchu Tv;nursery rhyme lyrics;music for children;twinkle twinkle little star;learn;Lyrics", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "channel_title": "ChuChu TV Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs", "description": "Get the cute Baby Taku's Toy Bestie Plush at the ChuChu TV Store.
